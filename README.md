# FootballPredictions
Football predictions made with Python and third-party API

Greetings everyone. Ever wanted to get rich with football bettings? Well, good luck then!
If you instead want to try (and have some fun, in the meanwhile) playing with football matches try my Python script that predicts football scores of the day.
This script consumes an API provided on RapidAPI named Football Prediction (freemium) and prints the fixtures and the results of today's matches in a text file on the project's folder.
The API is provided for free and paid. You have to register to obtain an API key and embed in your project, and then you choose the free version (only 25 requests per day, which, in my opinion, are all you need for football predictions), or you choose a paid version, which gives access to more predictions, like how many goals, scorer and so on.
